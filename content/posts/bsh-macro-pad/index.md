Let me introduce you to one of my projects, MacroPad. It is a versatile way to improve your workflows for programming, video editing, documents writing and much more!

A lot of people has access to a 3D printer nowadays and given the state of a global COVID19 pandemic a lot of them are working on their PCs from home. Each one of us has it's own way of approaching daily work rutines with different tools and strategies to minimize the amout of timelost, the efficiency is key factor! Working on a PC requieres a lot of clicking and clacking but we spend good amount of time just using the same buttons or combinations of multiple of them.

Why spend that additional time trying to remember that wierd key combination to do "that thing", when you can combine them in a single button and use it every time you need it? This keypad design has 24 keys that anyone can add their own key combinations and other cool actions, apart from that, it integrates 2 encoder whees that can give you that satisfying feel whey you are scrubbing throw a video or adjusting volume.

Cool, you got the idea!
