## About me

I'm Ukranian, but since 2007 I lived in Seville. I was always interested in mountain sports, mechanical engineering and computer sciences, thats why I've started my career as software developer in 2013. Since the start until nowadays I havenâ€™t stopped learning each day and improving my skills with the hope of continuing to create beautiful and performant applications that can help other people in their daily lives.
